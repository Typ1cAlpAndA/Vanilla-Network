# Vanilla-Network
Vanilla Network is a multi purpose command that supports commamds for both admins and just regular members.From checking the ping of your server to finding gifs and images the Vanilla Network bot can do quite a lot of things.

Commamds coming soon:
*daily
*slotmachine

This bot has basic commands like: *ban *kick *mute but a section for all admin commands will soon be added.
